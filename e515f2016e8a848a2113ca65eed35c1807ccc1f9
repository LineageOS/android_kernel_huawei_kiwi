      "message": "This change is actually changing the behaviour.\n\nIn the old code we could write 3 entries with the following delays:\n\ndelay, 0, delay\n\nand in the new code it would end up writing 3 entries\n\ndelay, 0, 0\n\nbecause you are changing delay which then changes it over all future iterations.\n\nIf you wanted to make a change like this you\u0027d need to add int this_entry_delay \u003d delay at the start of the for loop and then replace this line with this_entry_delay \u003d 0 and the assignment below as well.\n\nGiven all of that, I\u0027m not sure I see the value of making the change.",
